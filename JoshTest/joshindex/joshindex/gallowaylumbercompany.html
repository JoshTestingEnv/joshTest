						<h1>My First Job</h1>
								<p>While in high school at Moberly Senior High School, I took a class that allowed me to take a half a day from school and work during that half day. Galloway Lumber Company was my first job. After graduating High School I continued working at Galloway.  I would work my way to being the Yard Foreman, where I would manage four other employee's.  This was a challenge in itself considering I was at the young age of Eighteen.  However, I was succesful at what I did and made an impression on customers. </p>
